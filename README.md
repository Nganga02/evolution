This is a journey I am lost in whatever I want to pursue but the code I am pushing now just gave me confidence 
I have gone through it all from deleting my /bin deleting half of the project shit I even know where the trash is in 
ubuntu.
This is a sim that visualizes the population growth and distribution
I did this in an ubuntu machine so I will only help you run this thing in an ubuntu machine 
1. You'll need to run the following in your terminal 
  ```bs
      sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-2.0-0
  ```
2. Then in the evolution folder, you'll run the following
   ```bs
       make 
   ```
3. Finally you run the following
   ```bs
       ./bin/evolution <world-desc.wdf ><your output file>
   ```
If you liked what you see hit that star on the repository
